Explanation

1. BitSet: A fixed-size bit array to represent the Bloom Filter.
2. Hash Functions: Multiple hash functions are used to set bits in the BitSet. These functions should be independent to reduce the chances of collisions.
3. Add Method:
* Calculates hash values for an element using all hash functions.
* Sets the corresponding bits in the BitSet.

4. MightContain Method:
* Checks whether all bits for the hash values of an element are set.
* If any bit is not set, the element is definitely not in the set.
* If all bits are set, the element might be in the set (false positives possible).
